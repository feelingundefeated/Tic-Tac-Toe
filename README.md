Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game, that is played on a 3Ã—3 square grid. Each player occupies a cell in turns, with the objective of placing three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern.

The game of TicTacToe, while simple for us to understand, has quite a few challenges for us to deal with while coding. Things like displaying the game's board, allowing players to input moves, updating the game board, detecting a winner, and so on. Beyond this, we also have to think about where things might go wrong, such as players attempting to play where someone else has already played, or playing in a non-existent spot, and so on!

As you may be realizing now, despite the simplicity of TicTacToe, there are many smaller intricacies that we have to deal with and handle for that we just take for given when we play on a piece of paper. With any task like these where there are many things to be done, we need to just break down the entire objective, either in our head or in some notes. In this case, we know we need some basic things:

(1) Visualize the game somehow

(2) Allow players to enter moves

(3) Make sure moves are valid and handle if not.

(4) Determine if there's a winner.
